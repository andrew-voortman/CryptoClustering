# CryptoClustering

CryptoClustering 

## Description:   

Using knowledge of Python, sklearn and unsupervised learning to create models that learn from data and then make decisions/predictions about future data, and then test the accuracy of those models. The machine learning model we create will group cryptocurrencies in the crypto_market_data.csv file to assist with assembling investment portfolios based on the profitability of the individual cryptocurrencies.
